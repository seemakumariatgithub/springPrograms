There are three ways of handling exception in Spring:

  1. Controller level
  2. Global level
  3.

 1. Controller level
        For this in the controller class(@RestController), the Annotation used for exceptionHandler methos is 
            @ExceptionHandler(<comma seperated all the checked exceptions class name>)

  2. Global level
      For this in seperate folder/package create a class and annotate this class with
            @RestControllerAdvice
      Then add the @ExceptionHandler annotated methods in this class

  3.
