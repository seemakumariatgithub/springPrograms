1. Core Container
    This containes:
        -spring-core
        -spring-beans
        -spring-context
        -spring-context-support
        -spring-expression (Spel - Spring Expression Language)

        -spring-core: 
        -spring-beans:
            Above two modules provide fundamental parts of framework.
                including IoC and dependency injection feature.

            'BeanFactory' is the sophisticated implementation of factory pattern.
             This removes the need for programatic singleton
                and allows to decouple the configuration 
                    and specification of dependency from the program logic.

        -spring-context:
            - This is build on the solid base provided by 'spring-core' and 'spring-beans'.
            - This is the 'means' to access the object in framework-style.
            - This is also called as context module.
            - This module inherits its fetures from beans modules, 
                and adds support for 
                        - internationalization 
                        - event propogation
                        - resource loading
                        - transparent creation of context
            - This module also supports J2EE features, EJB, JMX, basic remoting.
            - The 'ApplicationContext' interface is the focal point of context module.
            
        -spring-context-support:
            This module provides support for integrating common third-party libraries 
                into the spring application context for:
                    1. caching (EhCache, Guava, JCache)
                    2. mailing(JavaMailing)
                    3. scheduling( CommonJ, Quatz)
                    4. templates engine(FreeMaker, JasperReport, Velocity)

        -spring-expression (Spel - Spring Expression Language):
                This provides powerful Expression Language, for querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime.
                This module supports:

                    2- property assignment
                    3- method invocation
                    4- accessing the contents of arrays, collections and indexers
                    5- Logical and arithmetic operators
                    6- named varriables
                    7- retrival of objects by name from IoC
                    8- lists projection and selection
                    9- common list aggregation

                    that implements functionality that should be seperated.
                - Using source level metadata functionality, we can incorporate behavioral information into the code.
