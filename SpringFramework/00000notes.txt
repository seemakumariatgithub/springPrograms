IoC: Inversion of Control
DI: Depedency Injection is the specialized version of IoC.
    In DI, the objects define their dependecies only through:
        1. Constructor argument
        2. Argument to the factory method
        3. Properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method.

The IoC container then inject those dependency when bean is created.

There are two packages that forms the basis of spring framework's IoC container, these are:
      1. org.springframework.beans
      2. org.springframework.context

1. BeanFactory Interface: 
            It provides the advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing any type of object.
            It is defeined in the org.springframework.beans.factory package.
            This is implemented by the object that holds many bean definitions, each uniquly identified by String name.

            BeanFactory centralizes the configuration of application components.
            BeanFactory is central registry for application component.
            This interface loads the bean efinition stored in the configuration source like xml.

                Bean factory implementations should support the standard bean lifecycle interfaces as far as possible. 
                The full set of initialization methods and their standard order is:                
                   1. BeanNameAware's setBeanName
                   2. BeanClassLoaderAware's setBeanClassLoader
                   3. BeanFactoryAware's setBeanFactory
                   4. EnvironmentAware's setEnvironment
                   5. EmbeddedValueResolverAware's setEmbeddedValueResolver
                   6. ResourceLoaderAware's setResourceLoader (only applicable when running in an application context)
                   7. ApplicationEventPublisherAware's setApplicationEventPublisher (only applicable when running in an application context)
                   8. MessageSourceAware's setMessageSource (only applicable when running in an application context)
                   9. ApplicationContextAware's setApplicationContext (only applicable when running in an application context)
                   10. ServletContextAware's setServletContext (only applicable when running in a web application context)
                   11. postProcessBeforeInitialization methods of BeanPostProcessors
                   12. InitializingBean's afterPropertiesSet
                   13. a custom init-method definition
                   14. postProcessAfterInitialization methods of BeanPostProcessors

                On shutdown of a bean factory, the following lifecycle methods apply:
                
                  1. postProcessBeforeDestruction methods of DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessors
                  2. DisposableBean's destroy
                  3. a custom destroy-method definition
    
2. ApplicationContext Interface: 
        This is the sub-interface of BeanFactory. 
        This is defined in 'org.springframework.context' package
        This Interface provides:
              1. Easier integration with AOP's features.
              2. Message resource handling
              3. Event publication
              4. Application layer specific context, like 'WebApplicatonContext' for Web application.
         This interface is the central interface to provide the configuration of an application.
